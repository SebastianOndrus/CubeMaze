CubeMaze

The point of this game is to navigate the cube through the field to its final position, which is marked by Yellow colour.
Cube can move freely on the white blocks, but not on the black ones. There are also 2 subtypes of road block, Markers(â–£) and Marked tiles.
When cube steps on marker, its bottom side will be marked by Markers colour.
Marked tile can be only stepped on , if the bottom side of cube is marked with the same colour as marker.
